The downloaded data is loaded into a Pandas data frame. The dataframe contains 194673 rows × 38 columns. 
A new dataframe containing relevant information for this study has been constructed which contains the following columns: 
Column name     ||	Description	                                        || Values
'SEVERITYCODE'	|| A code that indicates the severity of the collision 	||•	3—fatality
                                                                        ||•	2b—serious injury
                                                                        ||•	2—injury
                                                                        ||•	prop damage
                                                                        ||•	0—unknown
                                                                 
'Y'	|| Latitude  ||	Latitude in deg
'X'	|| Longitude ||	Longitude in deg
'ADDRTYPE' ||	  Collision address type	|| Three values possible:
                                        ||            Alley
                                        ||            Block 
                                        ||      Intersection
'SEVERITYDESC'||	A detailed description of the severity of the collision	||Text describing what happened
'COLLISIONTYPE'||	Collision type 	   || Text describing the type of collision
'INCDATE' ||	Date of the incident	
'SDTO_COLCODE' ||	State collision code ||	Numerical code described in metadata
'INNATENTIONIND'||	Whether the accident is due to inattention ||	 (Y/N) data will be changed to y=1, N=0 and missing data NaN
'UNDERINFL'	||Whether the driver was under the influence of alcohol or drugs||	(Y/N/1/0) data will be uniformed Y=1, N=0 and NaN for missing data
'WEATHER'	|| Description of weather conditions ||	Values: Blowing Sand/Dirt,Clear,Fog/Smog/Smoke,Other
                                               ||    Overcast,Partly Cloudy,Raining,Severe Crosswind,Sleet/Hail/Freezing Rain,Snowing,Unknown

'ROADCOND' ||	Description of the conditions of the road	Dry || Ice, Oil, Other, Sand/Mud/Dirt, Snow/Slush, Standing water, Unknown,Wet
'LIGHTCOND'	||description of light conditions.	            ||Dark-No Street lights,Dark-Street lights off,Dark-Street lights on, Dark-Unknown lighting
                                                            ||Dawn,Daylight,Dusk,Other , Unknown
                                                            
In all cases, the values coded as ‘UNKNOWN’ or ‘NAN’ will be removed from the dataframe.
All of the values will be hot-encoded for further analysis. 
-The severity of the collision will be related to weather and road conditions. Furthermore, the relation between light conditions and severity of condition will be studied. 
-Latitude and Longitude data will be used to map severe collisions and study if there are areas of the city where these kinds of collisions happen often.
